                    <p><strong>IBSEN</strong> is an LLM-based framework for generating controllable drama scripts with
                      agent characters. Besides traditional role-playing actor agents, we introduce the director agent
                      to serve as the centralized component, and instruct actor agents to follow the plot development.
                    </p>

                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p>Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like
                    character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the
                    level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole
                    storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that
                    generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent
                    writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their
                    characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the
                    plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot
                    that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of
                    the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse
                    drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the
                    characteristics of characters in the drama.</p>

                  <div class="video-file-player" style="text-align: center;">

                  <p></p><br>
                  <p>The implementation of the IBSEN framework is largely prompt-based, and one can easily construct
                    IBSEN agents on any publicly available general LLMs without fine-tuning. We test and evaluate IBSEN
                    in a drama scenario, meanwhile its framework design could be expanded to broader application cases,
                    especially agent-based interactive games that contain specialized plot objectives. Demo video above
                    shows a simple interactive surface implemented by RPG Maker MZ.</p>
                  <h2>Agent Architecture</h2>
                  <p><strong>Director Agent</strong> - The central component of IBSEN, drives the whole storyline
                    towards expected plot objectives.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Read the script settings, get predefined plot objectives $\langle G_1, G_2, \dots\rangle$
                    <li>Write a continuation story outline $S_G$ that adheres to the current $G$
                    <li>Translate the outline $S_G$ into detailed dialogue scripts $\langle\hat{T}_1, \hat{T}_2,
                      \dots\rangle_G$
                    <li>For each turn $\hat{T}=(r, \hat{u})$, generate instruction $I=\left\{S_G, Synopsis(\hat{u}),
                      keywords\right\}$ to hint the actor role $r$ how to respond $u$ that fits the storyline and the
                      character
                    <li>Check whether current objective $G_i$ is completed using the actual dialogue history
                      $\langle\dots,T_{j-1},T_j\rangle$; move to the next objective $G_{i+1}$ if completed, otherwise
                      still use the turn $\hat{T}_{j+1}$ generated before
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Actor Agent</strong> - The distributed component of IBSEN, specifically modified to better
                    suit the drama role-playing scenario.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Maintain three databases: Actor Profile $D_P$, Memory Database $D_M$ and Character Database
                      $D_C$ to store different categories of contents
                    <li>Use a first-person narrative monologue to interpret the content stored in the databases from the
                      perspective and voice of the role-playing character
                    <li>Maintain a dialogue log $L=\langle T_1, T_2, \dots\rangle$ as the short-term memory; earlier
                      dialogue turns will be gradually stored into databases for further retrieval
                    <li>Generate the response utterance $u$ using: role characteristics from $D_P$, related top memories
                      from $D_M$, character impressions from $D_C$, instruction $I$ from director, script background and
                      dialogue history from $L$
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Director-Actor-Player Collaboration</h2>
                  <p><img src="./assets/NX01bBo.png" alt="">
                    IBSEN also allows human players to participate in the plot and interact with other characters.
                    Though the player agent is controlled by humans, it can be seen as an actor agent that is not
                    controlled by the director, and can take any action at any turn of the dialogue.</p>
                  <p>The director needs to dynamically adjust the plot to accommodate player actions while maintaining
                    the development of the storyline:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If no player involvement, still develop the storyline according to the dialogue script generated
                      before</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, always re-generate the current storyline and dialogue scripts, unless the current
                      plot objective is completed</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Evaluations</h2>
                  <p>We create a novel interactive drama adopted from <em>Hedda Gabler</em> for evaluation. Check <a

                    <li>Most of the time, IBSEN follows the route of plot objectives and generates proper storylines,
                      while maintaining the characteristics in the dialogue.</li>
                    <li>New storylines generated by director tend to actively interact with the player.</li>
                    <li>Player involvement may influence the behaviors of actors and impact the plot.</li>
                    <li>Some common faults occasionally arise: high repetition, too many narrations, overly positive in
                      some negative events.</li>
                    <li>The backbone LLM influences the quality and the moral tendency of the responses.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Discussion</h2>
                  <p>The idea of "controllable plot generation" can be extended to broader scenarios besides traditional
                    drama. One of the most notable application fields is interactive gaming. For example, in
                    communication games like script role-playing and table RPG, human players need to communicate with
                    NPCs or each other to achieve certain tasks. In IBSEN, both the game master and NPCs can be
                    role-played by AI generative agents, providing players with flexible gaming experiences at any place
                    or time. As a backend framework, IBSEN can also be implemented in more complicated environments like
                    video games, where players can deeper immerse in human-like interactions with NPCs through
                    audio-visual elements. You may <a href="https://github.com/OpenDFM/ibsen/tree/main/frontend">take a
