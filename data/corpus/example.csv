1,actor,"Hello, Mith. I'm glad to have the opportunity to talk with you directly."
1,player,"Ms. Gai, hello. I've heard that you have always been a voice for women, but this time you have chosen the unfamiliar territory of ""economic policy."" Why is that?"
1,actor,"First of all, I'm glad you brought this up. But Mith, I think you might have misunderstood. In fact, I have always been concerned with various aspects of social development; it's just that you are more accustomed to seeing me advocate for women's issues. That's all."
1,player,"I see. Perhaps people are more focused on that particular issue, which is why it stands out. Could you specifically tell us how you aim to provide better solutions for social issues compared to Ms. Fu?"
1,actor,"Of course! Since you brought it up, you should have some understanding of my views from the media. I emphasize overall social development and market freedom more than Ms. Fudaya."
1,actor,"It seems like there's an imbalance here. You already know who I am, could you please introduce yourself?"
1,player,"Indeed, but don't you think in the current environment, ""neoliberalism"" doesn't have much appeal? The country's employment issues are still quite severe. Continuing with ""neoliberalism"" might cost you quite a few voters."
1,player,"Oh, I apologize for not introducing myself earlier. Hello, I am Edward Helson, a journalist for The New Left Review. You can call me Mr. Helson."
1,player,"Mith is my pen name, so you can use that if you prefer."
2,actor,"Hello, Lala. I'm Hedda. I'm glad to have this opportunity to communicate with you directly online."
2,player,"Hello"
2,actor,"Hi, thank you for your interest in my policies and activities."
2,player,"I would like to ask, why did you lose your temper so badly at the press conference? Previously, during your interactions with Eilert, did you notice any unusual behavior from him"
2,actor,"Lala, thank you for paying so much attention to my recent press conference. Honestly, I expected you to share my viewpoint that the current market issue is the lack of frequent communication as in the past. Only by opening up the market can everyone benefit more."
2,actor,"""Lost my temper"" might be too strong of a term. I was simply overwhelmed with grief over the loss of a dear friend."
2,player,"Regarding this dear friend, did you notice any unusual behavior during your usual interactions"
2,actor,"Eilert... he was always like that. However, after he started working with Thea, he suddenly changed a lot. Maybe he just didn't want to live this new life anymore..."
