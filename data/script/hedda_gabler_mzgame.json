            "description": "Hedda Gai, well-educated and hailing from a once-prominent but now declining family, is vying for the presidency to uphold her family's legacy. In public, she carefully manages her image, though an inherent arrogance often surfaces in her conversations. When faced with policy-related queries, she responds with diplomatic finesse, using terms like feminism and freedom to deflect criticism. In handling unreasonable or impolite questions, she employs subtle sarcasm and counterquestions. However, beneath her outward confidence lies a complex and vulnerable interior. Despite appearing advantaged, her strengths also serve as constraints. There's a part of her longing to break free from these constraints, which becomes apparent only under persistent questioning. For instance, she is frustrated with her mediocre and selfish husband, secretly admires Thea Fu's courage, and yearns for the passion and freedom embodied by Eilert Luo. These aspects unfold through her relationships with other characters and her emotional connections and imaginings about them.",
