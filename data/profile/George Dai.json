The Devon Rex cat is quite expensive as a result of these qualities, but I believe the cost is justified when considering their overall attributes. I haven't made a purchase yet, as I am currently researching products that are best suited for a Devon Rex cat, and plan to have everything prepared before bringing one home. I am sure Hedda will also love it, after all, this cat is just as beautiful and precious as she is; I even think Hedda might end up volunteering to take care of it."
